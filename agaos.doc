AgaOS/--Overview--                                         AgaOS/--Overview--

 The intention with AgaOS is that it will supply a very simple
 interface to the Amiga AGA hardware and leave a relatively small
 disk-footprint. It might not work out of the box for 4kB-intros,
 but 40kB-intros should be able to use it with ease. (The smallest
 executable among the examples deliveres 1896 bytes.)

 AgaOS provides the following:

 * Built as a link-library with each function separated into
   a separate unit, resulting in that only the functions that are
   really needed get included in the resulting executable.

 * Completely system-friendly in every aspect except the display-
   hardware. Only performance-gaining action is raising the priority
   a small step.

 * A simple, yet powerful copper-list generator.

 * A fast and easy-to-use AGA color-fader.

 * VBL handling which allows user-extendability and a "frame ready"-
   waiting that does not include busy-waiting.

 * Memory allocation with alignment handling, allocation tracking
   and overwrite detection.

 * Extensive documentation over every function, providing the user
   answers to many of the questions they may have without forcing
   them to read the actual code.

 * Complete library of matrix routines, written in FPU assembler,
   compatible with all available co-processors.

AgaOS/AttachVBLHook                                       AgaOS/AttachVBLHook

   NAME
       AttachVBLHook - Attach a new routine that will be executed
              in the vertical blanking period.

   SYNOPSIS
       success = AttachVBLHook(routine,userdata)
       d0                     a0       d0

       BOOL AttachVBLHook(void*,ULONG);

   FUNCTION

   INPUT
       routine - The routine that you want to execute at vertical
              retrace. It must point to a valid code-segment that
              ends with a RTS instruction.
       userdata - This data will be passed into the routine when
              it executes, and is placed in the register a0.
   RESULTS
       success - FALSE if we failed to add to internal VBL hook. This
              should only happen if there was no memory to allocate.

AgaOS/Startup                                                   AgaOS/Startup

   NAME
       Startup - Setup AgaOS for use

   SYNOPSIS
       success = Startup(flags)
       d0                d0

       BOOL Startup(ULONG flags);

   FUNCTION
       This functions sets up all the sub-systems that are contained
       within AgaOS and readies them for use.

       The following actions are taken:

              - Workbench messages are handled (and current path modified)
              - The priority is raised to 1 to avoid all pri 0-tasks
              - System is validated (SetPatch, AGA, etc)
              - Default-palettes are generated (White, Greyscale)
              - Math tables are generated
              - Needed libraries are opened
              - Memory-pools are created (chip & public)
              - Input-handler is installed
              - The system viewport is reset
              - VBL interrupt chain is started
   INPUT
       flags - Requirements for startup. Possible flags are:
              (mask together when using)

              AASTRF_FPU:       This program requires that an FPU is
                            present, and will fail if there is none.

   RESULTS
       success - FALSE if any error occured. If it did, you can NOT
              rely on that ANY AgaOS sub-system is set up. Skip
              directly to end of the program and call Shutdown().

   NAME
       WaitVBL - Wait for vertical retrace

   SYNOPSIS
       WaitVBL()

       void WaitVBL(void);

   FUNCTION
       This function sets the task into a waiting state that will
       be triggered when the vertical blanking interrupt has finished
       executing.

   INPUT

   RESULTS

   NOTES
       As AmigaOS is still executing in the background, it will be
       allowed to execute while we are inside this function. This
       is only a side-effect of exec/Wait(), but it´s what we want.

   SYNOPSIS

   FUNCTION

   INPUT
       coplist - Pointer to output copperlist
       ptr - Base pointer
       modulo - Distance between each pointer-block
       count - How many pointers to set
       copptr - Copper pointer-word to use when loading

   RESULTS
